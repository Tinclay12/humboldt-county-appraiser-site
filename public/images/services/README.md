# Service Images

Place service-specific images here. Create subdirectories for each service type:

- `residential/` - Residential property images
- `commercial/` - Commercial building images  
- `agricultural/` - Farm and ranch images
- `multifamily/` - Apartment and multi-unit property images
- `industrial/` - Warehouse and industrial facility images
- `vacant-land/` - Land and undeveloped property images

Each subdirectory should contain:
- `hero.jpg` or `hero.webp` - Hero image for the service page (recommended: 1200x600)
- Optional: Additional images for galleries or feature sections

Images will be used in service cards with glassmorphism overlays for text readability.
